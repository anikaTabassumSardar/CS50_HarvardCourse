# Problem Set 1
* Programming Language: C
* Coding environnment: https://ide.cs50.io/

## Project overview:
This project demonstrates basic understanding and implementation of programming concepts with the programming language C.

## Project(s) include:
### Hello
- Takes user input using cs50 library for strings and print greet user with their name.
- Project file: [hello.c](hello.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make hello.c
  - ./hello
  
### Mario (beginner)
- Takes user input for height and builds a pyramid like the mario game.
- Project file: [marioBeginner.c](marioBeginner.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make marioBeginner.c
  - ./marioBeginner
 - Pseudocode: [pseudocode_MarioBeginner.md](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/CS50_HarvardCourse/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20C/Snapshots%20%26%20Text%20Files/pseudocode_MarioBeginner.md)
 - Snapshot of the pyramid: [MarioBeginnerPyramid](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/CS50_HarvardCourse/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20C/Snapshots%20%26%20Text%20Files/MarioBeginnerPyramid.JPG)
 
### Mario (intermediate)

### Cash (beginner)

### Credit (intermediate)

## To run the app:
* For this problem set, youâ€™ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment. This environment is similar to CS50 Sandbox and CS50 Lab, the programming environments that David discussed during lecture.
