# Problem Set 2
* Programming Language: C
* Coding environnment: https://ide.cs50.io/

## Project overview:
This project demonstrates basic understanding and implementation of programming concepts with the programming language C.
- Concepts covered: 
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Command Line Arguments
  - Variables and Scope

## Project(s) include:
### Readability
- Implements a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.
- Project file: [readability.c](readability.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make readability
  - ./readability
- Snapshot:
  - [Test Cases 1](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/HarvardCourse-CS50_IntroductionToComputerScience/blob/master/Week%202%20-%20Arrays/Snapshots/testCases_caesar(1).PNG)
  - [Test Cases 2](https://github.com/anikaTabassumSardar/HarvardCourse-CS50_IntroductionToComputerScience/blob/master/Week%202%20-%20Arrays/Snapshots/testCases_caesar(2).PNG)

  
### Caesar (beginner)
- Implements a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.
- Project file: [caesarCipher.c](caesarCipher.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make caesarCipher
  - ./caesarCipher

### Substitution (intermediate)
- Implements a program that implements a substitution cipher.
- Project file: [substitutionCiper.c](substitutionCiper.c)
- Run the following commands:
  - make substitutionCiper
  - ./substitutionCiper

## To run the app:
* For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment. This environment is similar to CS50 Sandbox and CS50 Lab, the programming environments that David discussed during lecture.
